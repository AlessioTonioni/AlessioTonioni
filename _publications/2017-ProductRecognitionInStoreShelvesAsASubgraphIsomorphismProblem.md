## Abstract

The arrangement of products in store shelves is carefully planned to maximize sales and keep customers happy. Verifying compliance of real shelves to the ideal layout, however, is a costly task currently routinely performed by the store personnel. In this paper, we propose a computer vision pipeline to recognize products on shelves and verify compliance to the planned layout. We deploy local invariant features together with a novel formulation of the product recognition problem as a sub-graph isomorphism between the items appearing in the given image and the ideal layout. This allows for auto-localizing the given image within aisles of the store and improves recognition dramatically.
