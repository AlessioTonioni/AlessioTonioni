Hello!

I'm a researcher in computer vision and deep learning currently enrolled as a post doc at the Computer Vision Lab of the university of Bologna under the supervision of Professor Luigi Di Stefano.

I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Bologna on April 2019. 
During my PhD I have worked on deep learning solutions for product detection and recognition in retail environments and on deep learning applied to depth estimation from stereo and monocular cameras.

I am still working on depth estimation, but I'm also starting to explore more general research subjects like domain adaptation and meta learning.


## News
__2019__:

  * I will be at CVPR 2019 to present our two works on stereo depth estimation: [Real-time self-adaptive deep Stereo (Oral)](publication/realTime)  and [Learning To Adapt for Stereo](publication/L2A).
  * On the 22nd of May Me, Matteo Poggi and Oscar Rahnama will be at BMVA meeting on High-Performance Computing for Computer Vision to present our recent works on efficient depth estimation. See you there!
  * We have just released our last work where we show how it is possible to transform deep representation across domains and tasks. I believe it is a really exciting and under developed research field, check out our work! [Learning Across Tasks and Domains](publication/ATDT)
  * Our last work on Grocery Product Recognition has been published on CVIU, check it out: [Domain invariant hierarchical embedding for grocery products recognition](publication/DIHE).
  * Our paper on designing an efficient stereo systems for FPGA has been published on IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, check it out: [Real-Time Highly Accurate Dense Depth on a Power Budget using an FPGA-CPU Hybrid SoC](publication/FPGA).
