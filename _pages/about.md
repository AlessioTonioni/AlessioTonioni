Hello!

I'm a researcher in computer vision and deep learning and I'm currently working with Federico Tombari at Google Zurich. 
Previously I was enrolled as a post doc at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://www.vision.deis.unibo.it/) of the university of Bologna under the supervision of Professor Luigi Di Stefano.

I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Bologna on April 2019. 
During my PhD I have worked on deep learning solutions for product detection and recognition in retail environments and on deep learning applied to depth estimation from stereo and monocular cameras.

I am currently working on depth estimation, multimodal learning, generative models for images (and more) and complex text understanding tasks. 
If you are interested in working with me feel free to reach out!

P.S.: I also like to take photos, besides working with them, check [my seldomly updated Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/196993770@N03/)

## News
__2023__:
  * [AT/DT++](publication/ATDT2) has been accepted for publication on TPAMI.

__2022__:
  * We have uploaded to Arxive our latest work that enables editing of 3D aware Nerf based GAN: [LatentSwap3D](publication/LS3D), [code available](https://enisimsar.github.io/latentswap3d/)
  * We have uploaded to Arxive an old work which never made it out of the review process, the idea was simple but effective: making. a CycleGAN parametrizable --> [ParGAN](publication/ParGAN)
  * I was interviewed for the ProfessionAI podcast to share my experience as CV researcher, you can find the interview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfEJxyedtJQ)(italian only :/)
  * I was acknowledged as [**outstanding reviewer at ECCV22**](https://eccv2022.ecva.net/program/outstanding-reviewers/)!
  * [BNE](publication/BNE) has been accepted for publication on Pattern Recognition.
