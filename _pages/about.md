Hello!

I'm a researcher in computer vision and deep learning and I'm currently working with Federico Tombari at Google Zurich. 
Previously I was enrolled as a post doc at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://www.vision.deis.unibo.it/) of the university of Bologna under the supervision of Professor Luigi Di Stefano.

I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Bologna on April 2019. 
During my PhD I have worked on deep learning solutions for product detection and recognition in retail environments and on deep learning applied to depth estimation from stereo and monocular cameras.

I am still working on depth estimation, but I'm also starting to explore more general research subjects like domain adaptation and meta learning.


## News
__2019__:
  * Our paper [Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Depth Prediction from Images](publication/AdaptationJournal) has been accepted for publication on the RGBD special issue of TPAMI. We will release the code soon!
  * Our paper [Semi-Automatic Labeling for Deep Learning in Robotics](publication/ARS) has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering journal.
  * Our paper [Learning Across Tasks and Domains](publication/ATDT) got accepted at ICCV 2019 for a poster presentation! I wish to thank [Pierluigi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/pierluigi.zama) for the wonderful work. Stay tuned for the code release.
  * After 3.5 wonderful years at the Computer Vision Lab of Bologna it's time to move on, from July I will start a collaboration with the computer vision team of Federico Tombari at Google Zurich! So long Bologna, and thank you for all the fish!
  * My Phd thesis is finally online and provided with open access by UniBO [link](http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/8970/).
  * I will be at CVPR 2019 to present our two works on stereo depth estimation: [Real-time self-adaptive deep Stereo (Oral+Poster+Demo)](publication/realTime)  and [Learning To Adapt for Stereo (Poster)](publication/2019-L2A). See you there!
  * Me, [__Matteo Poggi__](https://vision.disi.unibo.it/~mpoggi/) and __Oscar Rahnama__ will be on the 22nd of May at BMVA meeting on High-Performance Computing for Computer Vision to present our recent works on efficient depth estimation. See you there!
  * We have just released our last work where we show how it is possible to transform deep representation across domains and tasks. I believe it is a really exciting and under developed research field, check it out! [Learning Across Tasks and Domains](publication/ATDT)
  * Our last work on Grocery Product Recognition has been published on CVIU, check it out: [Domain invariant hierarchical embedding for grocery products recognition](publication/DIHE).
  * Our paper on designing an efficient stereo systems for FPGA has been published on IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, check it out: [Real-Time Highly Accurate Dense Depth on a Power Budget using an FPGA-CPU Hybrid SoC](publication/FPGA).
  * I have successfully defended my Ph.D. Thesis titled "Computer Vision and Deep Learning for Retail Store Management", thank to Centro Studi for financing my Ph.D and to all my colleagues and friends for helping me during the last three years!
