Hello!

This is my personal webpage, I'm a researcher in computer vision currently working at the Computer Vision Lab of the university of Bologna with Professor Luigi Di Stefano.

I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Bologna on April 2019. 
Currently, I am a Post-doc researcher at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna.

During my PhD I have worked on deep learning solutions for product detection and recognition in retail environments and on deep learning applied to depth estimation from stereo and monocular cameras.

I am still working on depth estimation, but I'm also starting to explore more general research subjects like domain adaptation and meta learning.
